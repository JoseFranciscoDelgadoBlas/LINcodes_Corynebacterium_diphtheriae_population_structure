# LINcodes_Corynebacterium_diphtheriae_population_structure
This repository contains the input files and R scripts used to analyze the population structure of Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains using a ten-level, cgMLST-based LIN code system, as described in the publication "Life identification number (LIN) codes for the genomic taxonomy of Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains" by Jose F. Delgado-Blas et al. The resources provided generate circle packing charts to visualize hierarchical population structures and alluvial plots to display concordance between LIN code levels, facilitating detailed exploration of genomic relationships within the LIN code framework.
